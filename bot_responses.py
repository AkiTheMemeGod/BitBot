    "Who needs arguments anyway? Oh right, you do. Nice try though.",
    "Imagine forgetting an argument. Can't relate. Well, maybe just to you.",
    "You know, commands usually work better when you give them everything they need. Just a friendly tip.",
    "In the game of commands, you just made a critical failure. Try again, maybe with all the needed arguments this time.",
    "Did you think the command was a mind reader? It's not. Specify the missing argument, genius.",
    "Ah, the classic move of not providing the necessary argument. A bold strategy, let's see if it pays off.",
    "If the command could facepalm, it would be doing it right now because of you.",

    "The command was expecting a sidekick, not a solo act. Provide the missing argument, and maybe you'll get a callback.",
    "Next time you run a command, try not to leave it hanging like a cliffhanger in a bad movie. We all want a satisfying conclusion.",
    "You know, commands are like sandwiches â€” they're just not the same without all the fillings. Your command is currently a sad, empty sandwich.",
